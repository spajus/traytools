TrayTools is a framework for developing system tray based Java desktop applications.

It is done with lessons learned from development of [Hawkscope](http://hawkscope.googlecode.com) - a pluggable tray application for accessing your hard drive contents.

TrayTools is based on [Eclipse SWT](http://www.eclipse.org/swt).
